## logicReference ##
### logicReference will be a live webpage to interactively learn about basic logic gates and structures. The project will be worked on without a schedule on a do-it-when-you-can-or-want-to basis. ###

## What is this repository for? ##

### This project will be a learning experience with the intent to pass knowledge of how to: ###

* Setup a webpage with the WAMP interface</li>
* Get a good grasp on the functionality and use of HTML, PHP, CSS, Javascript, and git.</li>
* Interact with a live server which we'll push everything too when we reach our target state</li>
* Work with a team (especially using git) as most CS jobs are team based</li>
* something else

### How do I get set up? ###

* Setup instructions will be updated as needed
