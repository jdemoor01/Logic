<h2>logicReference</h2> 
<h3>logicReference will be a live webpage (static) that uses javascript to interactively learn about basic logic gates and structures.
The project will be worked on without a schedule on a do-it-when-you-can-or-want-to basis.</h3>

### What is this repository for? ###

<h3>This project will be a learning experience with the intent to pass knowledge of how to:<h3>
<ul>
<li>Setup a webpage with the WAMP interface</li>
<li>Get a good grasp on the functionality and use of HTML, PHP, CSS, Javascript, and git.</li>
<li>Interact with a live server which we'll push everything too when we reach our target state</li>
<li>Work with a team (especially using git) as most CS jobs are team based</li>
</ul>

### How do I get set up? ###

<h3>Setup instructions will be updated as needed</h3>
